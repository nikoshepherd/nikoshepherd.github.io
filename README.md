# Niko Shepherd Github pages
Hugo website

### Deployment
To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `hugo` to start building websites, then run `hugo server` or `hugo server --disableFastRender` to start the HUGO server.
I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/) page on HUGO website.
